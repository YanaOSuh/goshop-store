# eCommerce clothing website. 

React Filter: an easy-to-use filtering system that allows customers to sort products by category and gender.
This is the project I have made completely alone with my current React.js skills.
I created this project for my web-developer courses and also because I wanted to practice in my current web development skills.

Additionally, I have practiced creating components in React, navigating between components using React Router and useNavigate, and using data files and useState hook. I havr created catalog, three blocks (contact, sale and hero-page) and a single product page.

## Project Status
This project is currently in development. Users can filter clothes by gender and categories and see visual data representation. Soon I am planning to add shopping cart, checkout functionality and membership registration. And adaptive design will be available soon.
